	bc command is a calculator application. This command performs the the arithmetic operations. The bc command first reads any input files specified by the file parameter and then reads the standard input. Arithmetic operations performed like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Functions supported by bc command are: scale, sqrt, len, read, var++, var--, ++var, --var. Options supported by bc command are: --help, file, -i, -l, -w, -s, -q, -v.
	
	bc is a language that supports arbitrary precision numbers with interactive execution of statements. bc starts by processing code from all the files listed on the command line in the order listed. After all files have been processed, bc reads from the standard input. All code is executed as it is resd. If a file contains a command to halt the processor, bc will never read from the standard input.
	
	bc is a language that supports arbitrary precision numbers with inter‚Äêactive execution of statements. There are some similarities in the syntax to the C programming language. A standard math library is available by command line option. If requested, the math library is defined before processing any files. bc starts by processing code from all the files listed on the command line in the order listed. After all files have been processed, bc reads from the standard input. All code is executed as it is read. (If a file contains a command to halt the processor, bc will never read from the standard input). This version of bc contains several extensions beyond traditional bc implementations and the POSIX draft standard. Command line options can cause these extensions to print a warning or to be rejected. This document describes the language accepted by this processor. Extensions will be identified as such.
